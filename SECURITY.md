## üö® Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in the Pocket Agents companion code, please follow these steps:

### 1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to prevent exploitation.

### 2. **Email the maintainer**
Send an email to the repository maintainer with:
- **Subject**: `[SECURITY] Vulnerability Report - Pocket Agents Companion Code`
- **Description**: Detailed description of the vulnerability
- **Steps to reproduce**: Clear steps to reproduce the issue
- **Impact assessment**: Potential impact of the vulnerability
- **Suggested fix**: If you have ideas for fixing the issue

### 3. **Response timeline**
- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Resolution**: Within 30 days (or communication about timeline)

### 4. **What to include in your report**
- **Affected files/functions**: Specific code locations
- **Attack vector**: How the vulnerability could be exploited
- **Privilege requirements**: What access level is needed
- **Data exposure**: What information could be compromised
- **Proof of concept**: If you have a working exploit (keep it minimal)

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

### Model Security
- **Model files**: Large model files are excluded from the repository
- **Model validation**: Always verify model checksums before use
- **Model sources**: Only use models from trusted sources

### API Security
- **No hardcoded keys**: All examples use environment variables
- **Key rotation**: Implement proper API key management
- **Rate limiting**: Be aware of API rate limits in examples

### Data Security
- **Local processing**: Examples prioritize local data processing
- **No data collection**: Examples don't collect or transmit user data
- **Privacy-first**: All examples respect user privacy

### Code Security
- **Dependency management**: Regular updates of dependencies
- **Input validation**: Proper validation of user inputs
- **Error handling**: Secure error handling without information leakage

## üîç Security Best Practices

### For Users
1. **Keep dependencies updated**: Regularly update Python packages
2. **Use virtual environments**: Isolate project dependencies
3. **Verify downloads**: Check file checksums for model files
4. **Review code**: Understand what code you're running
5. **Monitor resources**: Watch for unexpected resource usage

### For Developers
1. **Input sanitization**: Validate all user inputs
2. **Error handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in errors
3. **Dependency scanning**: Regularly scan for vulnerable dependencies
4. **Code review**: Review all code changes for security issues
5. **Testing**: Include security testing in your workflow

## üö´ Known Security Limitations

### Model Loading
- **File system access**: Model loading requires file system access
- **Memory usage**: Large models may consume significant memory
- **Process isolation**: Models run in the same process as your code

### Network Access
- **Model downloads**: Some examples download models from the internet
- **API calls**: Some examples make API calls (clearly documented)
- **Dependency installation**: Package installation requires network access

### System Access
- **Hardware monitoring**: Some examples monitor system resources
- **File operations**: Examples may read/write files
- **Process management**: Some examples manage system processes

## üîß Security Tools

### Recommended Tools
- **Safety**: Check for known security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- **Bandit**: Static analysis tool for finding security issues
- **Semgrep**: Code analysis tool for security patterns
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates

### Usage Examples
```bash
# Check for security vulnerabilities
pip install safety
safety check

# Static security analysis
pip install bandit
bandit -r .

# Dependency updates
# Enable Dependabot in GitHub repository settings
```

## üìã Security Checklist

Before publishing code:

- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] Error handling doesn't expose sensitive info
- [ ] Dependencies are up to date
- [ ] No unnecessary file system access
- [ ] Clear documentation of security implications
- [ ] Tested with security tools

## üìû Contact Information

For security-related questions or reports:
- **Email**: [Maintainer email]
- **GitHub**: Create a private security advisory
- **Response time**: 48 hours for acknowledgment
