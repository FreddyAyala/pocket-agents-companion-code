# Contributing to Pocket Agents Companion Code

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Pocket Agents companion code! This repository contains practical implementations and examples from the book "Pocket Agents: A Practical Guide to On-Device Artificial Intelligence."

## ü§ù How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues
- **Bug Reports**: If you find a bug in any of the code examples, please create an issue with:
  - Clear description of the problem
  - Steps to reproduce
  - Expected vs actual behavior
  - Your system information (OS, Python version, etc.)

- **Feature Requests**: For new examples or improvements, please describe:
  - What you'd like to see added
  - How it would benefit other users
  - Any implementation ideas you have

### Code Contributions

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Create a feature branch**: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
3. **Make your changes**:
   - Follow the existing code style
   - Add appropriate comments and docstrings
   - Update README files if needed
   - Test your changes thoroughly
4. **Commit your changes**: `git commit -m "Add: brief description"`
5. **Push to your fork**: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
6. **Create a Pull Request**

## üìã Contribution Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 for Python code
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to functions and classes
- Include type hints where appropriate

### Documentation
- Update README files when adding new features
- Include setup instructions for new examples
- Add comments explaining complex logic
- Update the main README table if adding new chapters

### Testing
- Test all code examples before submitting
- Verify setup scripts work on clean environments
- Check that notebooks run without errors
- Test on different Python versions when possible

## üéØ Areas for Contribution

### High Priority
- **Performance improvements** for existing examples
- **Additional model support** (new GGUF models, formats)
- **Cross-platform compatibility** fixes
- **Memory optimization** techniques
- **Error handling** improvements

### Medium Priority
- **New deployment examples** (Docker, Kubernetes)
- **Additional inference engines** (TensorRT, CoreML)
- **Mobile deployment** examples (iOS, Android)
- **Web deployment** improvements

### Low Priority
- **Documentation improvements**
- **Code refactoring**
- **Additional test cases**
- **Example datasets**

## üö´ What Not to Contribute

- **Large model files** (use .gitignore patterns)
- **API keys or secrets** (use environment variables)
- **Personal data** or copyrighted content
- **Breaking changes** without discussion
- **Dependencies** that conflict with existing ones

## üìö Book Integration

Remember that this code accompanies the book "Pocket Agents." When contributing:

- **Maintain educational value** - code should teach concepts
- **Keep examples focused** - one concept per example
- **Include clear explanations** - help readers understand the "why"
- **Follow book structure** - organize by chapters as shown

## üêõ Bug Fixes

For bug fixes, please:
1. **Identify the root cause** - don't just patch symptoms
2. **Test the fix thoroughly** - ensure it doesn't break other functionality
3. **Update documentation** if the fix changes behavior
4. **Add test cases** to prevent regression

## üí° Enhancement Ideas

### Performance
- Optimize memory usage in model loading
- Improve inference speed
- Reduce startup time
- Better GPU utilization

### Usability
- Better error messages
- More intuitive APIs
- Improved setup scripts
- Better progress indicators

### Features
- Support for more model formats
- Additional deployment targets
- Better configuration management
- Enhanced monitoring tools

## üìû Getting Help

- **GitHub Issues**: For bugs and feature requests
- **Discussions**: For questions and general discussion
- **Book**: Reference the main book for theoretical background

## üìÑ License
