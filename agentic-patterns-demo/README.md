# 🎓 Agentic Patterns Demo

**Chapter 12 Companion Code - Educational Agentic AI Patterns**

This is the educational companion code for Chapter 12 that demonstrates agentic AI patterns with mock responses. Perfect for learning the concepts without needing heavy dependencies.

## 🎯 What This Is

- **Educational Focus**: Learn agentic patterns step by step
- **Mock Responses**: No real model loading required
- **Pattern Clarity**: Clear implementations of each concept
- **Interactive Notebook**: 8 complete sections with demos
- **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Simple setup
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install jupyter notebook
jupyter notebook agentic_workflows.ipynb
```

## 📋 Key Files

- **`agentic_workflows.ipynb`** - Interactive tutorial with 8 sections
- **`agentic_patterns.py`** - Core pattern implementations
- **`README.md`** - This file

## 🎓 Learning Sections

1. **Setup and Imports** - Environment setup
2. **Agentic Loop Demo** - THINK→ACT→OBSERVE→RESPOND cycle
3. **Context Management** - Tier-based context pruning
4. **Tool Calling Patterns** - Tool registry and execution
5. **Error Handling** - Robust error recovery
6. **Multi-Agent Collaboration** - Specialist agents
7. **Complete System Demo** - Full integration

## ⚠️ Mock vs. Real

- **This Demo**: Mock responses, educational patterns
- **Hero Project**: Real model loading, production system

## 🎯 This vs. Hero Project

- **This (Patterns Demo)**: Learn the concepts with mock data
- **Hero Project**: Use real model with actual inference

Both are essential for understanding on-device AI agents!
