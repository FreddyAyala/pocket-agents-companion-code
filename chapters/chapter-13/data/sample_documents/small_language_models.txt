Small Language Models (SLMs) are compact versions of large language models designed 
to run efficiently on local devices. They typically have fewer than 10 billion parameters 
and are optimized for speed and memory efficiency.

Key advantages of SLMs include:
- Local processing and privacy
- Lower computational requirements
- Faster inference times
- Reduced memory usage
- Cost-effective deployment

Popular SLMs include TinyLlama, Phi-3, Qwen2.5, and Gemma-2B.

SLMs are particularly useful for:
- On-device AI applications
- Edge computing scenarios
- Privacy-sensitive applications
- Resource-constrained environments
