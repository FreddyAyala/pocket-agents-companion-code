Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines information retrieval 
with text generation. RAG systems retrieve relevant documents from a knowledge base and 
use them as context for generating more accurate and informed responses.

RAG systems typically consist of:
1. A document store or knowledge base
2. A retrieval system (vector search)
3. A generation model (language model)
4. A ranking and filtering mechanism

Benefits of RAG include improved accuracy, reduced hallucinations, and the ability to 
incorporate up-to-date information without retraining the model.

RAG is particularly effective for:
- Question answering systems
- Document summarization
- Knowledge-intensive tasks
- Domain-specific applications
