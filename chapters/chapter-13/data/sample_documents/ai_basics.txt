Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create 
intelligent machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. 
These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.

Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on algorithms that can learn from data 
without being explicitly programmed. Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that 
uses neural networks with multiple layers to model and understand complex patterns.

Key areas of AI include:
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Computer Vision
- Robotics
- Expert Systems
- Neural Networks
