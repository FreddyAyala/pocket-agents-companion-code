# Chapter 9: The Hardware Battlefield

This companion code explores the hardware landscape for on-device AI deployment.

## Contents

- `hardware_battlefield_demo.ipynb` - Hardware optimization and benchmarking
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `setup_and_test.sh` - Setup script

## Quick Start

1. Run `./setup_and_test.sh` to install dependencies
2. Launch Jupyter: `jupyter notebook hardware_battlefield_demo.ipynb`
3. Follow the notebook to explore hardware optimization

## What This Demonstrates

- CPU vs GPU vs NPU performance comparison
- Memory optimization techniques
- Thermal management strategies
- Power efficiency measurements
- Platform-specific optimizations
