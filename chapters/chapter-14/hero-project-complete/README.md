# 🚀 Hero Project: Complete On-Device AI Agent

**Chapter 14 Capstone Project - Working AI Agent with Actual Model Loading**

This is the complete, production-ready Hero Project that actually loads and uses the real Qwen3-4B-Instruct model. This is the capstone project from Chapter 14 - a working AI agent system.

## 🎯 What This Is

- **Real Model Loading**: Downloads and uses actual Qwen3-4B-Instruct GGUF model
- **ChromaDB Vector Store**: Real knowledge base with embeddings
- **RAG Agent**: Question answering with real model inference
- **Task Agent**: File operations and automation with real model
- **Vision Support**: Image analysis capabilities
- **Gradio UI**: Complete web interface
- **OpenAI API Server**: Compatible API endpoint

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Setup and run
./setup_and_test.sh
./launch_hero_ui.sh
```

## 📥 Model Download

The Hero Project requires the Qwen3-4B-Instruct model (~2.5GB). The setup script will automatically download it, but you can also download manually:

```bash
# The model will be downloaded automatically during setup
# If you need to download manually:
huggingface-cli download unsloth/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507-GGUF --local-dir ./models/
```

## 📋 Key Files

- **`notebooks/hero_project_demo.ipynb`** - Interactive demo with real model
- **`simple_hero_ui.py`** - Gradio web interface
- **`openai_api_server.py`** - OpenAI-compatible API server
- **`src/`** - Core implementation (model_loader, agents, tools)

## 🧠 Technology Stack

- **Model**: Qwen3-4B-Instruct (GGUF format)
- **Framework**: llama-cpp-python for GGUF inference
- **Vector DB**: ChromaDB with sentence-transformers
- **UI**: Gradio with real-time streaming
- **Vision**: PIL for image processing

## ⚠️ Requirements

This requires heavy dependencies:
- torch>=2.0.0
- transformers>=4.36.0
- llama-cpp-python>=0.2.0
- chromadb>=0.4.0
- And more...

## 🎯 This vs. Agentic Patterns Demo

- **This (Hero Project)**: Real working system with actual model
- **Agentic Patterns Demo**: Educational patterns with mock responses

Both are valuable but serve different purposes!
